## 🔍 Key Insights

### Feature Impact Analysis

| Feature | Coefficient | Impact | Business Interpretation |
|---------|-------------|--------|------------------------|
| **Smoker_encoded** | +$23,848.53 | 🔴 **Highest** | Smoking increases costs by ~$23,849 |
| **Age** | +$256.86 | 🟡 **High** | Each year adds ~$257 to premium |
| **BMI** | +$339.19 | 🟡 **High** | Each BMI unit adds ~$339 |
| **Number_of_Children** | +$475.50 | 🟢 **Medium** | Each child adds ~$476 |
| **Gender_encoded** | -$131.31 | 🟢 **Low** | Gender has minimal impact |
| **Region_encoded** | -$352.96 | 🟢 **Low** | Region has moderate impact |

### Business Insights
1. **🚭 Smoking is the dominant risk factor** - Smokers pay ~239% more than non-smokers
2. **👴 Age matters significantly** - Older customers have higher premiums
3. **⚖️ BMI impacts costs** - Higher BMI correlates with higher insurance costs
4. **👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family size affects premiums** - More children = higher costs
5. **🌍 Geographic and gender differences are minimal**
